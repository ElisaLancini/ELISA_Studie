## About The Project

Our study explores to what extent variance in early (c.a 30 Minutes) and delayed (7 days) memory performance in a group of pathology assessed older adults (65-90 years old) is explained by the variance of the volume of medial temporal lobe memory structures and the volume/signal intensity of the SN and LC. We will also study the effects of dopaminergic drug treatment (L-DOPA) on memory consolidation and assess how the effects of L-DOPA are dependent on the structural integrity of dopaminergic (SN) and noradrenergic(LC) regions.

### Hypotheses 

1. Amyloid-negative older healthy individuals with lower memory performances will have lower integrity of dopaminergic and noradrenergic regions compared to those who are high performing. 
2. A treatment with a single dose of L-DOPA after encoding will strengthen the consolidation of the memory trace in the low- performing group, resulting in higher memory performances compared to the high- performing and the placebo groups Furthermore.
3. The degree of improvement will depend on the integrity of the LC and SN/VTA. 

Based on the results by Chowdhury et al., (2012), and considering the “dopamine overdose” hypothesis (Vaillancourt et al., 2013), we also expect that

4. L-DOPA will enhance memory in participants with less structural integrity, and impair the performances of those with higher integrity. Thus, we postulate a combined influence of dopaminergic and noradrenergic structural integrity and L-DOPA dose on memory performance.

## The task

The Object-Scene task is a behavioural memory task already established in our lab (Grande et al, in preparation). The stimuli consist of pictures of rooms that contain two objects (task trials) or are empty (control trials). 

During the encoding phase, 70 trials were presented, 50 task trials and 20 control trials. 
In the task trials the participants see a room with two objects, then the same room but empty, with a red circle indicating a certain position in the room. Simultaneously three objects are presented below the room. This is the selection phase, in which the participant is asked to decide which of the three objects was in that position. 
The participant can select between the correct object (cue), the object that was in the room but not in that position (internal lure) or a new object (external lure).
After the selection, the room with the two objects is presented again as a feedback on the performance. 
During the control trials the task is not mnemonic but perceptual. The room is always empty and the task in the selection phase is to select the part of the room that corresponds to the section inside the circle. 
There are two encoding runs, as showed by the arrows in Figure 5, the rooms were presented twice, once in the first half and once in the second half of the experiment, the difference between the two runs lies in the position of the circles in the selection phase. This repetition of the room, changing the position of the circle, assure that the participant is encoding both the objects in the room. The details of the task timing are reported in Appendix III. 
There were two retrieval phases, after 30 minutes and after one week. In both sessions, all the rooms are presented in one run (70 stimuli). Empty rooms are presented, then in the categorization phase we asked the participant whether the room contained objects or not. Independently of the answer, the selection phase is presented. In these sessions there is no feedback to avoid a second encoding. 
The difference between the two retrieval sessions is the position of the circle in the room during the selection phase (Figure 6). 
Breaks were present in all the tasks, 7 during encoding, 3 during retrieval. The participants saw a black screen informing them about the possibility of rest. The 4th pause-screen of the encoding sessions informed the participants also that half of the experiment was reached and that from that moment all rooms would be presented again, but with the red circle in another position. The duration of the breaks was at discretion of the participants.
